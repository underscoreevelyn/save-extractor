# BTD6 Save Extractor
A simple web tool to extract a map save from a BTD6 primary save file  

Based vaguely on [Monke](https://github.com/codeshaunted/monke), a command line save decrypter for NK games, and [SalvageIt](https://github.com/Trixep/SalvageIt), a mod that lets you import the extracted saves. It also uses [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate) because I couldn't get the native browser deflation to work.  

This work is public domain. Use it however you like.
